Task 1: Foundational Research Strategy
Description: Develop a comprehensive research strategy for the given {topic}. This includes identifying the most relevant academic databases (e.g., PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science), key search terms, and inclusion/exclusion criteria for the literature search.
The strategy should also outline a plan for identifying seminal works and highly cited articles to establish a foundational understanding.
Expected Output: A structured document outlining the research strategy. This should include:
1. A list of recommended academic databases.
2. A primary and secondary set of keywords and search strings.
3. Clearly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria for study selection (e.g., publication date range, study types, language).
4. A brief justification for the chosen strategy.

Task 2: Literature Search and Curation
Description: Execute the research strategy to conduct a thorough search of the selected academic databases. Systematically screen the search results based on the defined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Curate a list of the most relevant and high-quality research articles, including clinical trials, meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and key cohort studies.
Expected Output: A curated list of research articles in a standardized format (e.g., BibTeX or a structured list with titles, authors, journal, publication year, and DOI). The list should be categorized by study type.

Task 3: Critical Appraisal of Evidence
Description: Critically appraise the methodological quality and reliability of the curated research articles. For each key article, evaluate the study design, sample size, statistical methods, potential for bias (e.g., selection bias, confounding factors), and the validity of the conclusions. Pay close attention to the hierarchy of evidence, giving more weight to systematic reviews and large, well-designed clinical trials.
Expected Output: A summary of the critical appraisal for the top 5-10 most impactful articles. This summary should highlight the strengths and limitations of each study and provide an overall assessment of the evidence quality for the {topic}.

Task 4: Synthesis of Findings and Trend Identification
Description: Synthesize the findings from the appraised literature to identify key trends, significant discoveries, and existing gaps in the research on the {topic}. Trace the evolution of research in this area and identify any emerging methodologies or conflicting findings.
Expected Output: A comprehensive synthesis of the research findings. This document should include:
1. An overview of the current state of research on the {topic}.
2. A summary of the key trends and major findings.
3. Identification of any controversies or areas of conflicting evidence.
4. A list of identified gaps in the current literature.



AGENT 2
Task 1: Executive Summary Formulation
Description: Based on the synthesized research findings provided by the Academic Research Specialist, draft a concise and impactful executive summary. 
This summary should be understandable to a non-specialist audience and highlight the most critical findings and their implications.
Expected Output: A well-structured executive summary of no more than 250 words.

Task 2: Detailed Report Generation
Description: Transform the synthesized research and critical appraisal into a detailed and well-structured report. The report should be organized logically with clear headings and subheadings. 
It must present the information in a clear, objective, and easily digestible format. Where applicable, use tables and figures to summarize key data points.
Expected Output: A comprehensive report that includes:
1. An introduction to the {topic}.
2. A methodology section detailing the research strategy.
3. A detailed results section presenting the key findings from the literature.
4. A discussion section that interprets the findings, discusses their implications, and highlights the limitations of the current body of research.
5. A conclusion that summarizes the main points of the report.

Task 3: Data Visualization and Presentation
Description: Identify key data points and trends from the research that can be effectively communicated through visual aids. Create clear and informative visualizations such as charts, graphs, or infographics to be embedded within the final report. Ensure all visualizations are accurately labeled and referenced.
Expected Output: A set of 3-5 high-quality visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, flowcharts) that visually represent the key research findings.

Task 4: Final Report Finalization and Formatting
Description: Review the entire report for clarity, coherence, accuracy, and grammatical correctness. Ensure a consistent and professional formatting throughout the document. 
Add a title page, table of contents, and a list of references in a standard citation style (e.g. APA).
Expected Output: A finalized report in a clean and professional format (e.g., PDF or Markdown). The report should be free of errors.
