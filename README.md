# MARS (Medical Assistant for Research Synthesis)

## Overview

MARS is a project that leverages the power of AI agents, built with crewai to conduct research in medicine. It automates the process of information gathering and report generation.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Research**: Utilizes a `researcher` agent equipped with search tools to gather comprehensive information.
*   **Automated Reporting**: Employs a `reporting_analyst` agent to synthesize the researched data and generate a structured report in Markdown format.
*   **Dynamic Report Naming**: Saves reports with a timestamp and a sanitized version of the research topic for easy identification.
*   **Extensible**: Built with crewAI, allowing for easy customization and addition of new agents or tasks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10 - 3.13
*   CrewAI
*   **SERPER_API_KEY**: An environment variable for the Google Serper API, used by the `researcher` agent for web searches. You can get one from [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your_repository_url_here>
    cd mars
    ```
    *(Replace `<your_repository_url_here>` with the actual URL of the repository)*

2.  **Set up the environment variable:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `mars` directory and add your Serper API key:
    ```
    SERPER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies using CrewAI:**
    ```bash
    crewai install
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  **Ensure your CrewAI environment is active or run commands with `crewai run`:**
    ```bash
    crewai run
    ```

2.  **Enter the research topic:**
    The application will prompt you:
    ```
    Whats the topic you want to conduct your research on?
    Type below:
    ```
    Enter your desired topic and press Enter.

3.  **Find the results:**
    Once the research is complete, the generated report will be saved as a Markdown file in the `mars/results/` directory. The filename will be in the format: `DD-MM-YYYY_HH-MM-SS_topic.md`.

```

*   `src/mars/main.py`: The main script to run the research crew.
*   `src/mars/crew.py`: Contains the definitions for the `researcher` and `reporting_analyst` agents, their tasks, and how they form a `Crew`.
*   `src/mars/config/agents.yaml` & `src/mars/config/tasks.yaml`: Configuration files defining the properties, backstories, goals, and descriptions for the agents and tasks.
*   `results/`: This directory stores all the output reports generated by the research crew.
*   `knowledge/`: This directory can be used to store files that provide a knowledge base for the AI agents.
*   `pyproject.toml`: Defines project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

## How it Works

1.  The user runs the application (`crewai run `).
2.  The `main.py` script prompts the user for a research topic.
3.  The input topic, along with the current timestamp, is passed to the `Mars` crew defined in `crew.py`.
4.  The `Mars` crew kicks off its process:
    *   The **`researcher` agent** receives the topic and uses the `SerperDevTool` to perform web searches and gather relevant information.
    *   The **`reporting_analyst` agent** takes the information compiled by the researcher.
    *   It then performs a `synthesis_and_analysis_task`.
    *   Finally, it executes the `final_report_creation_task`, using the `FileWriterTool` to save the synthesized report as a Markdown file in the `mars/results/` directory. The filename includes the timestamp and a sanitized version of the topic.
5.  The `format_folder` function in `crew.py` (called via `@after_kickoff`) attempts to clean up any `.md` files from the project's root directory. *(Note: This function had a hardcoded path and has been updated to be more robust).*
